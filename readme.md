# How to run this program
1. Open an integrated terminal in the server folder.
2. Type in "node server.js" in the newly opened terminal. This will load the data from the csv file in the data folder.
3. While the server is still running, open the index.html from the client folder with the live server so that the data from the server can be shown on the webpage.
